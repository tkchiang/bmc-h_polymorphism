### Analysis scripts to accompany the paper "Polymorphic _in vitro_ assembly of a bacterial microcompartment shell protein"

`nanotube_TEM_analysis.ipynb` is a Jupyter notebook that automates the analysis of nanotube TEM images, extracting nanotube diameters and chiral angles.

`SAXS_MCMC/` contains:
  - `run_SAXS_MCMC.ipynb` is a Jupyter notebook that implements MCMC on processed small-angle x-ray scattering data and generates backend files for each experiment.
  - `backend_analysis.ipynb` is a Jupyter notebook that analyzes the `emcee` backend files generated by `SAXS_MCMC.ipynb`.
  - `saxs_models.py` contains functions for plotting and defining the SAXS models used for fitting the data.
  - `5djb_FoXS.dat` contains the simulated scattering curve of a BMC-H subunit (PDB ID: 5DJB), computed using FoXS and interpolated to match the data.

`cgMD_curvature_analysis/` contains:
  - `cgMD_trajectory_analysis.ipynb` is a Jupyter notebook that reads cgMD trajectory data of BMC-H hexamer lattice sheets and computes the local curvature of the sheets over time.

The associated data will be stored elsewhere for review.
